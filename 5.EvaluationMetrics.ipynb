    "\n",
    "\n",
    "MAE calculates the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values  \n",
    "It gives a clear view of the model’s prediction accuracy but it doesn't shows whether the errors are due to over- or under-prediction. It is simple to calculate and interpret helps in making it a good starting point for model evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "MAE = 1/N*(sum(|Ypredicted - Yactial|))\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n",
    "MSE calculates the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. Squaring the differences ensures that larger errors are penalized more heavily helps in making it sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "This is useful when large errors are undesirable but it can be problematic when outliers are not relevant to the model’s purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE = 1/N*(sum(|Ypredicted - Yactial|**2))\n",

    "### 3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n",
    "We want the penalty of MSE , but readability of MAE . so , take the Square root of MSE \n",

    "### 4. R² (R-squared)\n",
    "R-squared is a statistical measure that represents the goodness of fit of a regression model. The value of R-square lies between 0 to 1. Where we get R-square equals 1 when the model perfectly fits the data and there is no difference between the predicted value and actual value.  However, we get R-square equals 0 when the model does not predict any variability in the model and it does not learn any relationship between the dependent and independent variables.\n",

    "R-square is a comparison of the residual sum of squares (SSres) with the total sum of squares(SStot).\n",

    "The more the value of the r-square near 1, the better the model is. \n",

    "Accuracy is a fundamental metric used for evaluation the performance of a classification model . it tells us the proportion of correct predictions made by the model out of all predictions\n",

    "it can be misleading in cases of imbalanced datasets. For example, in a dataset with 90% class A and 10% class B, a model predicting only class A will still achieve 90% accuracy but it will fail to identify any class B instances.\n",

    "### Precision \n",
    "It measures how many of the positive predictions made by the model are actually correct. It's useful when the cost of false positives is high such as in medical diagnoses where predicting a disease when it’s not present can have serious consequences\n",
