    "Linear Regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that learns from the labelled datasets and maps the data points with most optimized linear functions which can be used for prediction on new datasets . it assumes that there is a linear relationship between the input and outpu , meaning the output changes at a constant rate as the input changes . This relation ship is represented by a straight line . \n",
